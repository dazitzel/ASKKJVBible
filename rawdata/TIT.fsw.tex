\enubox{1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;}

\enubox{2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;}

\enubox{3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;}

\enubox{4 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.}

\enubox{5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:}

\enubox{6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.}

\enubox{7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;}

\enubox{8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;}

\enubox{9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.}

\enubox{10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:}

\enubox{11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.}

\enubox{12 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.}

\enubox{13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;}

\enubox{14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.}

\enubox{15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.}

\enubox{3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.}

\enubox{4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,}

\enubox{5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;}

\enubox{6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;}

\enubox{7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.}

\enubox{8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.}

\enubox{9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.}

\enubox{10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;}

\enubox{11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.}

\enubox{12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.}

\enubox{13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.}

\enubox{14 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.}

\enubox{15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.}
