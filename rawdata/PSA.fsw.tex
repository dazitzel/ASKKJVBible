\enubox{20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.}

\enubox{21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.}

\enubox{22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.}

\enubox{23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.}

\enubox{24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.}

\enubox{25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.}

\enubox{26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.}

\enubox{27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.}

\enubox{28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.}

\enubox{29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.}

\enubox{30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.}

\enubox{31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.}

\enubox{32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.}

\enubox{33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.}

\enubox{34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.}

\enubox{35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.}

\enubox{36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.}

\enubox{37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.}

\enubox{38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.}

\enubox{39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.}

\enubox{40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.}

\enubox{1 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.}

\enubox{2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.}

\enubox{3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.}

\enubox{4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.}

\enubox{5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.}

\enubox{6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.}

\enubox{7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.}

\enubox{8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.}

\enubox{9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.}

\enubox{10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.}

\enubox{11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.}

\enubox{12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.}

\enubox{13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.}

\enubox{14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.}

\enubox{15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.}

\enubox{16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.}

\enubox{17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.}

\enubox{18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.}

\enubox{19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.}

\enubox{20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.}

\enubox{21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.}

\enubox{22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.}

\enubox{1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.}

\enubox{2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.}

\enubox{3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.}

\enubox{4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.}

\enubox{5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.}

\enubox{6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.}

\enubox{7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,}

\enubox{8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.}

\enubox{9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.}

\enubox{10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.}

\enubox{11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.}

\enubox{12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.}

\enubox{13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.}

\enubox{14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.}

\enubox{15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.}

\enubox{16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.}

\enubox{1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.}

\enubox{2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?}

\enubox{3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?}

\enubox{4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.}

\enubox{5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.}

\enubox{6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.}

\enubox{7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.}

\enubox{8 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.}

\enubox{9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?}

\enubox{10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?}

\enubox{11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.}

\enubox{3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.}

\enubox{4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.}

\enubox{1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.}

\enubox{2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.}

\enubox{3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.}

\enubox{4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.}

\enubox{5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.}

\enubox{6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.}

\enubox{7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.}

\enubox{8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.}

\enubox{9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.}

\enubox{10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.}

\enubox{11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.}

\enubox{12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.}

\enubox{13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.}

\enubox{14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.}

\enubox{15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,}

\enubox{16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.}

\enubox{17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.}

\enubox{18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;}

\enubox{19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.}

\enubox{20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;}

\enubox{21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.}

\enubox{22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.}

\enubox{23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.}

\enubox{24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?}

\enubox{25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.}

\enubox{26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.}

\enubox{2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.}

\enubox{3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.}

\enubox{4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.}

\enubox{5 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.}

\enubox{6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.}

\enubox{7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.}

\enubox{8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.}

\enubox{9 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.}

\enubox{10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;}

\enubox{11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.}

\enubox{12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.}

\enubox{13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.}

\enubox{14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.}

\enubox{15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.}

\enubox{16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.}

\enubox{17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.}

\enubox{1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.}

\enubox{2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.}

\enubox{3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.}

\enubox{4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.}

\enubox{5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.}

\enubox{6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.}

\enubox{7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;}

\enubox{8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.}

\enubox{9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?}

\enubox{10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?}

\enubox{11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.}

\enubox{12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.}

\enubox{1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.}

\enubox{2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.}

\enubox{3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.}

\enubox{4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.}

\enubox{5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.}

\enubox{6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.}

\enubox{7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.}

\enubox{4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.}

\enubox{5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.}

\enubox{6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.}

\enubox{8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.}

\enubox{9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.}

\enubox{10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.}

\enubox{11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.}

\enubox{3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.}

\enubox{4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.}

\enubox{5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:}

\enubox{6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.}

\enubox{7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.}

\enubox{8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.}

\enubox{5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?}

\enubox{6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.}

\enubox{7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.}

\enubox{8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.}

\enubox{9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.}

\enubox{6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:}

\enubox{7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.}

\enubox{8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.}

\enubox{9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.}

\enubox{10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.}

\enubox{11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.}

\enubox{12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.}

\enubox{12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.}

\enubox{13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,}

\enubox{14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.}

\enubox{15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.}

\enubox{7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:}

\enubox{8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.}

\enubox{9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.}

\enubox{18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.}

\enubox{19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.}

\enubox{20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.}

\enubox{21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.}

\enubox{22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:}

\enubox{23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.}

\enubox{24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.}

\enubox{25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.}

\enubox{26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.}

\enubox{27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.}

\enubox{28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.}

\enubox{29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.}

\enubox{30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.}

\enubox{31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.}

\enubox{32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:}

\enubox{33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.}

\enubox{34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.}

\enubox{2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.}

\enubox{3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.}

\enubox{4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.}

\enubox{14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.}

\enubox{15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.}

\enubox{16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.}

\enubox{17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.}

\enubox{18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.}

\enubox{19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.}

\enubox{20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.}

\enubox{21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.}

\enubox{22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.}

\enubox{23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.}

\enubox{24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.}

\enubox{25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.}

\enubox{26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.}

\enubox{27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.}

\enubox{28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.}

\enubox{29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.}

\enubox{30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.}

\enubox{31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.}

\enubox{32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.}

\enubox{33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.}

\enubox{34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.}

\enubox{35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.}

\enubox{1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.}

\enubox{2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.}

\enubox{3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.}

\enubox{4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.}

\enubox{5 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.}

\enubox{6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.}

\enubox{7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.}

\enubox{8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.}

\enubox{9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.}

\enubox{10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.}

\enubox{11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?}

\enubox{12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.}

\enubox{13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.}

\enubox{14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.}

\enubox{15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.}

\enubox{16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;}

\enubox{17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.}

\enubox{18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.}

\enubox{19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.}

\enubox{20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.}

\enubox{23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.}

\enubox{24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.}

\enubox{3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.}

\enubox{4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.}

\enubox{11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.}

\enubox{12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.}

\enubox{13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.}

\enubox{14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.}

\enubox{15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.}

\enubox{20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.}

\enubox{1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.}

\enubox{2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:}

\enubox{3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.}

\enubox{4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.}

\enubox{5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:}

\enubox{6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:}

\enubox{7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:}

\enubox{8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.}

\enubox{9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.}

\enubox{10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;}

\enubox{11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.}

\enubox{12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.}

\enubox{13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.}

\enubox{14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.}

\enubox{15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.}

\enubox{16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.}

\enubox{17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.}

\enubox{18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.}

\enubox{19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?}

\enubox{20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?}

\enubox{21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;}

\enubox{22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:}

\enubox{23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,}

\enubox{24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.}

\enubox{25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.}

\enubox{26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.}

\enubox{27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:}

\enubox{28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.}

\enubox{29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;}

\enubox{30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,}

\enubox{31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.}

\enubox{32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.}

\enubox{33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.}

\enubox{34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.}

\enubox{35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.}

\enubox{36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.}

\enubox{37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.}

\enubox{38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.}

\enubox{39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.}

\enubox{40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!}

\enubox{41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.}

\enubox{42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.}

\enubox{43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.}

\enubox{44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.}

\enubox{45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.}

\enubox{46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.}

\enubox{47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.}

\enubox{48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.}

\enubox{49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.}

\enubox{50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;}

\enubox{51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:}

\enubox{52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.}

\enubox{53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.}

\enubox{54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.}

\enubox{55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.}

\enubox{56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:}

\enubox{57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.}

\enubox{58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.}

\enubox{59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:}

\enubox{60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;}

\enubox{61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.}

\enubox{62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.}

\enubox{63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.}

\enubox{64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.}

\enubox{65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.}

\enubox{66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.}

\enubox{67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:}

\enubox{68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.}

\enubox{69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.}

\enubox{70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:}

\enubox{71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.}

\enubox{72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.}

\enubox{41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.}

\enubox{42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.}

\enubox{43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.}

\enubox{7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.}

\enubox{8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.}

\enubox{9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.}

\enubox{10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.}

\enubox{11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.}

\enubox{12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.}

\enubox{13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.}

\enubox{14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;}

\enubox{15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.}

\enubox{16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;}

\enubox{17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.}

\enubox{18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.}

\enubox{19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.}

\enubox{20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.}

\enubox{21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.}

\enubox{22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.}

\enubox{23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.}

\enubox{24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.}

\enubox{25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.}

\enubox{26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.}

\enubox{27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.}

\enubox{28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.}

\enubox{29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.}

\enubox{30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.}

\enubox{31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.}

\enubox{32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.}

\enubox{33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.}

\enubox{34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.}

\enubox{35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.}

\enubox{7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.}

\enubox{8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.}

\enubox{9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;}

\enubox{10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:}

\enubox{11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:}

\enubox{12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.}

\enubox{13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;}

\enubox{14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;}

\enubox{15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.}

\enubox{16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.}

\enubox{17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:}

\enubox{18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:}

\enubox{19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.}

\enubox{20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.}

\enubox{21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:}

\enubox{22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.}

\enubox{23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.}

\enubox{24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.}

\enubox{25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.}

\enubox{26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.}

\enubox{27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.}

\enubox{28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.}

\enubox{29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.}

\enubox{30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.}

\enubox{31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.}

\enubox{32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.}

\enubox{33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.}

\enubox{34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,}

\enubox{35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.}

\enubox{36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.}

\enubox{37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.}

\enubox{38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.}

\enubox{39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.}

\enubox{40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.}

\enubox{41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.}

\enubox{42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.}

\enubox{43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:}

\enubox{44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;}

\enubox{4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;}

\enubox{5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.}

\enubox{6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.}

\enubox{7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.}

\enubox{8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.}

\enubox{9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.}

\enubox{10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.}

\enubox{11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.}

\enubox{12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.}

\enubox{13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:}

\enubox{14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.}

\enubox{15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.}

\enubox{16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.}

\enubox{17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.}

\enubox{18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.}

\enubox{19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.}

\enubox{20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.}

\enubox{21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;}

\enubox{22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.}

\enubox{23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.}

\enubox{24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:}

\enubox{25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.}

\enubox{26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:}

\enubox{27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.}

\enubox{28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.}

\enubox{29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.}

\enubox{30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.}

\enubox{31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.}

\enubox{32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:}

\enubox{33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.}

\enubox{34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:}

\enubox{35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.}

\enubox{36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.}

\enubox{37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,}

\enubox{38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.}

\enubox{39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.}

\enubox{40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.}

\enubox{41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.}

\enubox{42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.}

\enubox{43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.}

\enubox{44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:}

\enubox{45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.}

\enubox{46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.}

\enubox{47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.}

\enubox{4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.}

\enubox{5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.}

\enubox{6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.}

\enubox{7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.}

\enubox{8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!}

\enubox{13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.}

\enubox{14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.}

\enubox{15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!}

\enubox{16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.}

\enubox{17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.}

\enubox{18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.}

\enubox{21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!}

\enubox{22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.}

\enubox{23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;}

\enubox{24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.}

\enubox{25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.}

\enubox{26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.}

\enubox{27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.}

\enubox{28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.}

\enubox{29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.}

\enubox{30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.}

\enubox{31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!}

\enubox{32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.}

\enubox{33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;}

\enubox{34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.}

\enubox{35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.}

\enubox{36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;}

\enubox{37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.}

\enubox{38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.}

\enubox{39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.}

\enubox{40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.}

\enubox{41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.}

\enubox{1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;}

\enubox{2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.}

\enubox{3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.}

\enubox{4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.}

\enubox{5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?}

\enubox{6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?}

\enubox{7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;}

\enubox{8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.}

\enubox{1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.}

\enubox{2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?}

\enubox{3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.}

\enubox{4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.}

\enubox{5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:}

\enubox{6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:}

\enubox{7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.}

\enubox{8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.}

\enubox{9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.}

\enubox{10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.}

\enubox{11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.}

\enubox{12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.}

\enubox{13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.}

\enubox{14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.}

\enubox{15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.}

\enubox{16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.}

\enubox{17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.}

\enubox{1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.}

\enubox{2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.}

\enubox{3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.}

\enubox{4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.}

\enubox{5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.}

\enubox{6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.}

\enubox{7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.}

\enubox{8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.}

\enubox{9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.}

\enubox{10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:}

\enubox{11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.}

\enubox{12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?}

\enubox{13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.}

\enubox{14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.}

\enubox{15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.}

\enubox{16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.}

\enubox{17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.}

\enubox{56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.}

\enubox{1 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.}

\enubox{2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.}

\enubox{3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.}

\enubox{4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.}

\enubox{5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.}

\enubox{6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.}

\enubox{7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.}

\enubox{1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.}

\enubox{2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.}

\enubox{3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.}

\enubox{4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.}

\enubox{5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.}

\enubox{6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.}

\enubox{7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.}

\enubox{8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.}

\enubox{9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.}

\enubox{10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.}

\enubox{11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.}

\enubox{12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.}

\enubox{11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:}

\enubox{12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:}

\enubox{13 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:}

\enubox{14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.}
