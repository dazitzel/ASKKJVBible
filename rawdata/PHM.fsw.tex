\enubox{1 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,}

\enubox{2 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:}

\enubox{3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.}

\enubox{4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,}

\enubox{5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;}

\enubox{6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.}

\enubox{7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.}

\enubox{8 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,}

\enubox{9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.}

\enubox{10 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:}

\enubox{11 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:}

\enubox{12 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:}

\enubox{13 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:}

\enubox{14 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.}

\enubox{15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;}

\enubox{16 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?}

\enubox{17 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.}

\enubox{18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;}

\enubox{19 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.}

\enubox{20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.}

\enubox{21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.}

\enubox{22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.}

\enubox{23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;}

\enubox{24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.}

\enubox{25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.}
