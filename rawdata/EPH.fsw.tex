\enubox{1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:}

\enubox{2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.}

\enubox{3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:}

\enubox{4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:}

\enubox{5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,}

\enubox{6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.}

\enubox{7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;}

\enubox{8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;}

\enubox{9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:}

\enubox{10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:}

\enubox{11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:}

\enubox{12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.}

\enubox{15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,}

\enubox{16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;}

\enubox{17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:}

\enubox{18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,}

\enubox{19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,}

\enubox{20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,}

\enubox{21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:}

\enubox{1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;}

\enubox{2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:}

\enubox{3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.}

\enubox{4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,}

\enubox{5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)}

\enubox{6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:}

\enubox{7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.}

\enubox{8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:}

\enubox{9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.}

\enubox{10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.}

\enubox{11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;}

\enubox{12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:}

\enubox{13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.}

\enubox{14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;}

\enubox{15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;}

\enubox{16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.}

\enubox{17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:}

\enubox{18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;}

\enubox{19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,}

\enubox{20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.}

\enubox{21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:}

\enubox{22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.}

\enubox{23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.}

\enubox{24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.}
