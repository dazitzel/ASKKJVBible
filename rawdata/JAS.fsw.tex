\enubox{1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.}

\enubox{2 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;}

\enubox{3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.}

\enubox{4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.}

\enubox{5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.}

\enubox{6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.}

\enubox{7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.}

\enubox{8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.}

\enubox{9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:}

\enubox{10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.}

\enubox{11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.}

\enubox{12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.}

\enubox{13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:}

\enubox{14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.}

\enubox{15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.}

\enubox{16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.}

\enubox{17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.}

\enubox{18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.}

\enubox{19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:}

\enubox{20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.}

\enubox{21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.}

\enubox{22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.}

\enubox{23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:}

\enubox{24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.}

\enubox{25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.}

\enubox{26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.}

\enubox{27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.}

\enubox{1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.}

\enubox{2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;}

\enubox{3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:}

\enubox{4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?}

\enubox{5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?}

\enubox{6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?}

\enubox{7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?}

\enubox{8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:}

\enubox{9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.}

\enubox{10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.}

\enubox{11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.}

\enubox{12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.}

\enubox{13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.}

\enubox{14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?}

\enubox{15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,}

\enubox{16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?}

\enubox{17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.}

\enubox{19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.}

\enubox{20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?}

\enubox{21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?}

\enubox{22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?}

\enubox{23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.}

\enubox{24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.}

\enubox{25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?}

\enubox{26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.}

\enubox{1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.}

\enubox{2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.}

\enubox{3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.}

\enubox{4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.}

\enubox{5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!}

\enubox{6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.}

\enubox{7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:}

\enubox{8 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.}

\enubox{9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.}

\enubox{10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.}

\enubox{11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?}

\enubox{12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.}

\enubox{13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.}

\enubox{14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.}

\enubox{15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.}

\enubox{16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.}

\enubox{17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.}

\enubox{18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.}

\enubox{3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.}

\enubox{4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.}

\enubox{5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?}

\enubox{7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.}

\enubox{9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.}

\enubox{10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.}

\enubox{11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.}

\enubox{12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?}

\enubox{13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:}

\enubox{14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.}

\enubox{15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.}

\enubox{16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.}

\enubox{17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.}

\enubox{13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.}

\enubox{14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:}

\enubox{15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.}

\enubox{16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.}

\enubox{17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.}

\enubox{18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.}

\enubox{19 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;}

\enubox{20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.}
