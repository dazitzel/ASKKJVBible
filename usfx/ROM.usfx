<ve /><v id="3" bcv="ROM.1.3" /> \begin{signline}Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="ROM.1.4" /> \begin{signline}And declared\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="ROM.1.5" /> \begin{signline}By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="ROM.1.6" /> \begin{signline}Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="ROM.1.7" /> \begin{signline}To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="8" bcv="ROM.1.8" /> \begin{signline}First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="ROM.1.9" /> \begin{signline}For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="ROM.1.10" /> \begin{signline}Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="ROM.1.11" /> \begin{signline}For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="ROM.1.12" /> \begin{signline}That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="ROM.1.13" /> \begin{signline}Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="ROM.1.14" /> \begin{signline}I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="ROM.1.15" /> \begin{signline}So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="ROM.1.16" /> \begin{signline}For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="ROM.1.17" /> \begin{signline}For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="18" bcv="ROM.1.18" /> \begin{signline}For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="ROM.1.19" /> \begin{signline}Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="ROM.1.20" /> \begin{signline}For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="ROM.1.21" /> \begin{signline}Because that, when they knew God, they glorified\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="ROM.1.22" /> \begin{signline}Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="ROM.1.23" /> \begin{signline}And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="24" bcv="ROM.1.24" /> \begin{signline}Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="ROM.1.25" /> \begin{signline}Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="ROM.1.26" /> \begin{signline}For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="ROM.1.27" /> \begin{signline}And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="ROM.1.28" /> \begin{signline}And even as they did not like to retain God in\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}their\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="ROM.1.29" /> \begin{signline}Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="ROM.1.30" /> \begin{signline}Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="ROM.1.31" /> \begin{signline}Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="ROM.1.32" /> \begin{signline}Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="2" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="ROM.2.1" /> \begin{signline}Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="ROM.2.2" /> \begin{signline}But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="ROM.2.3" /> \begin{signline}And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="ROM.2.4" /> \begin{signline}Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="ROM.2.5" /> \begin{signline}But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="ROM.2.6" /> \begin{signline}Who will render to every man according to his deeds:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="ROM.2.7" /> \begin{signline}To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="ROM.2.8" /> \begin{signline}But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="ROM.2.9" /> \begin{signline}Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="ROM.2.10" /> \begin{signline}But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="ROM.2.11" /> \begin{signline}For there is no respect of persons with God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="ROM.2.12" /> \begin{signline}For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="ROM.2.13" />\begin{signline}(For not the hearers of the law\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="ROM.2.14" /> \begin{signline}For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="ROM.2.15" /> \begin{signline}Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}their\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="17" bcv="ROM.2.17" /> \begin{signline}Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="ROM.2.18" /> \begin{signline}And knowest\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}his\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="ROM.2.19" /> \begin{signline}And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="ROM.2.20" /> \begin{signline}An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="ROM.2.21" /> \begin{signline}Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="ROM.2.22" /> \begin{signline}Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="ROM.2.23" /> \begin{signline}Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="ROM.2.24" /> \begin{signline}For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="ROM.2.25" /> \begin{signline}For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="ROM.2.26" /> \begin{signline}Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="ROM.2.27" /> \begin{signline}And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="ROM.2.28" /> \begin{signline}For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="ROM.2.29" /> \begin{signline}But he\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the heart, in the spirit,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not in the letter; whose praise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not of men, but of God.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="2" bcv="ROM.3.2" /> \begin{signline}Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="ROM.3.3" /> \begin{signline}For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="ROM.3.4" /> \begin{signline}God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.\end{signline}
