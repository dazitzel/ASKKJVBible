<ve /><v id="13" bcv="ECC.1.13" /> \begin{signline}And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}things\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="ECC.1.14" /> \begin{signline}I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}vanity and vexation of spirit.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="3" bcv="ECC.2.3" /> \begin{signline}I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="ECC.2.4" /> \begin{signline}I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="ECC.2.5" /> \begin{signline}I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}kind of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}fruits:\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="8" bcv="ECC.2.8" /> \begin{signline}I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}musical instruments, and that of all sorts.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="ECC.2.9" /> \begin{signline}So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="ECC.2.10" /> \begin{signline}And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="ECC.2.11" /> \begin{signline}Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}vanity and vexation of spirit, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no profit under the sun.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="12" bcv="ECC.2.12" />\begin{signline}¶ And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}can\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the man\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}do\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that cometh after the king?\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that which hath been already done.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="ECC.2.13" /> \begin{signline}Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="ECC.2.14" /> \begin{signline}The wise man’s eyes\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="ECC.2.15" /> \begin{signline}Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}vanity.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="ECC.2.16" />\begin{signline}For\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}man\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}? as the fool.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="17" bcv="ECC.2.17" /> \begin{signline}Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}grievous unto me: for all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}vanity and vexation of spirit.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="18" bcv="ECC.2.18" />\begin{signline}¶ Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="ECC.2.19" /> \begin{signline}And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}man\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}also vanity.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="ECC.2.20" /> \begin{signline}Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="ECC.2.21" /> \begin{signline}For there is a man whose labour\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}for\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}his portion. This also\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}vanity and a great evil.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="ECC.2.22" /> \begin{signline}For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="ECC.2.23" /> \begin{signline}For all his days\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="24" bcv="ECC.2.24" />\begin{signline}¶\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}There is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}nothing better for a man,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}than\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that he should eat and drink, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}from the hand of God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="ECC.2.25" /> \begin{signline}For who can eat, or who else can hasten\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}hereunto\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, more than I?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="ECC.2.26" />\begin{signline}For\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}God\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}giveth to a man that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him that is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}good before God. This also\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}vanity and vexation of spirit.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="10" bcv="ECC.3.10" /> \begin{signline}I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="11" bcv="ECC.3.11" /> \begin{signline}He hath made every\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thing\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="ECC.3.12" /> \begin{signline}I know that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no good in them, but for\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}a man\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to rejoice, and to do good in his life.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="ECC.3.13" /> \begin{signline}And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the gift of God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="ECC.3.14" /> \begin{signline}I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}should fear before him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="ECC.3.15" /> \begin{signline}That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="16" bcv="ECC.3.16" />\begin{signline}¶ And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}wickedness\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}there; and the place of righteousness,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}iniquity\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}there.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="ECC.3.17" /> \begin{signline}I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a time there for every purpose and for every work.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="ECC.3.18" /> \begin{signline}I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="ECC.3.19" /> \begin{signline}For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}vanity.\end{signline}

<p><v id="1" bcv="ECC.4.1" /> \begin{signline}So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}such as were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}power; but they had no comforter.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="5" bcv="ECC.4.5" /> \begin{signline}The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="ECC.4.6" /> \begin{signline}Better\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}an handful\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}with\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}quietness, than both the hands full\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}with\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}travail and vexation of spirit.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="8" bcv="ECC.4.8" /> \begin{signline}There is one\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}alone\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is there\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}saith he\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}also vanity, yea, it\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a sore travail.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="9" bcv="ECC.4.9" />\begin{signline}¶ Two\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="ECC.4.10" /> \begin{signline}For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}alone when he falleth; for\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}he hath\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not another to help him up.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="12" bcv="ECC.4.12" /> \begin{signline}And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="15" bcv="ECC.4.15" /> \begin{signline}I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.\end{signline}

Surely this also\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}vanity and vexation of spirit.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="5" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="ECC.5.1" /> \begin{signline}Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.\end{signline}
