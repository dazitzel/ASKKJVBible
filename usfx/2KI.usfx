<p><v id="1" bcv="2KI.1.1" /> \begin{signline}Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2KI.1.2" /> \begin{signline}And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2KI.1.3" /> \begin{signline}But the angel of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Is it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not because\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not a God in Israel,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2KI.1.4" /> \begin{signline}Now therefore thus saith the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="5" bcv="2KI.1.5" />\begin{signline}¶ And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="2KI.1.6" /> \begin{signline}And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline},\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Is it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not because\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not a God in Israel,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="2KI.1.7" /> \begin{signline}And he said unto them, What manner of man\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was he\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}which came up to meet you, and told you these words?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2KI.1.8" /> \begin{signline}And they answered him,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}He was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Elijah the Tishbite.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="9" bcv="2KI.1.9" /> \begin{signline}Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2KI.1.10" /> \begin{signline}And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2KI.1.11" /> \begin{signline}Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2KI.1.12" /> \begin{signline}And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="2KI.1.13" />\begin{signline}¶ And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2KI.1.14" /> \begin{signline}Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2KI.1.15" /> \begin{signline}And the angel of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2KI.1.16" /> \begin{signline}And he said unto him, Thus saith the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not because\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="17" bcv="2KI.1.17" />\begin{signline}¶ So he died according to the word of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned  in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2KI.1.18" /> \begin{signline}Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="2" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="2KI.2.1" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, when the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2KI.2.2" /> \begin{signline}And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}unto him, As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}liveth, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2KI.2.3" /> \begin{signline}And the sons of the prophets that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it;\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}hold ye your peace.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2KI.2.4" /> \begin{signline}And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}hath sent me to Jericho. And he said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}liveth, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="2KI.2.5" /> \begin{signline}And the sons of the prophets that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it;\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}hold ye your peace.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="2KI.2.6" /> \begin{signline}And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}hath sent me to Jordan. And he said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}liveth, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="2KI.2.7" /> \begin{signline}And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2KI.2.8" /> \begin{signline}And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="9" bcv="2KI.2.9" />\begin{signline}¶ And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2KI.2.10" /> \begin{signline}And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing:\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}nevertheless\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, if thou see me\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}when I am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2KI.2.11" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there appeared\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="12" bcv="2KI.2.12" />\begin{signline}¶ And Elisha saw\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="2KI.2.13" /> \begin{signline}He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2KI.2.14" /> \begin{signline}And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2KI.2.15" /> \begin{signline}And when the sons of the prophets which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="16" bcv="2KI.2.16" />\begin{signline}¶ And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="2KI.2.17" /> \begin{signline}And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2KI.2.18" /> \begin{signline}And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="19" bcv="2KI.2.19" />\begin{signline}¶ And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}naught, and the ground barren.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="2KI.2.20" /> \begin{signline}And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="2KI.2.21" /> \begin{signline}And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}land\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="2KI.2.22" /> \begin{signline}So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="23" bcv="2KI.2.23" />\begin{signline}¶ And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="2KI.2.24" /> \begin{signline}And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="2KI.2.25" /> \begin{signline}And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="3" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="2KI.3.1" /> \begin{signline}Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2KI.3.2" /> \begin{signline}And he wrought evil in the sight of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2KI.3.3" /> \begin{signline}Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="4" bcv="2KI.3.4" />\begin{signline}¶ And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="2KI.3.5" /> \begin{signline}But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="6" bcv="2KI.3.6" />\begin{signline}¶ And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="2KI.3.7" /> \begin{signline}And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}as thou\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, my people as thy people,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}my horses as thy horses.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2KI.3.8" /> \begin{signline}And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2KI.3.9" /> \begin{signline}So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2KI.3.10" /> \begin{signline}And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2KI.3.11" /> \begin{signline}But Jehoshaphat said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Is there\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not here a prophet of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, that we may enquire of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Here\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2KI.3.12" /> \begin{signline}And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="2KI.3.13" /> \begin{signline}And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2KI.3.14" /> \begin{signline}And Elisha said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2KI.3.15" /> \begin{signline}But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}came upon him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2KI.3.16" /> \begin{signline}And he said, Thus saith the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, Make this valley full of ditches.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="2KI.3.17" /> \begin{signline}For thus saith the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2KI.3.18" />\begin{signline}And this is\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}but\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a light thing in the sight of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="2KI.3.19" /> \begin{signline}And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="20" bcv="2KI.3.20" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="21" bcv="2KI.3.21" />\begin{signline}¶ And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="2KI.3.22" /> \begin{signline}And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}red as blood:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="2KI.3.23" /> \begin{signline}And they said, This\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="2KI.3.24" /> \begin{signline}And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}their\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}country.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="2KI.3.25" /> \begin{signline}And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and smote it.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="26" bcv="2KI.3.26" />\begin{signline}¶ And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto the king of Edom: but they could not.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="2KI.3.27" /> \begin{signline}Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}for\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}their own\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}land.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="4" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="2KI.4.1" /> \begin{signline}Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2KI.4.2" /> \begin{signline}And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2KI.4.3" /> \begin{signline}Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}empty vessels; borrow not a few.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="29" bcv="2KI.4.29" /> \begin{signline}Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="2KI.4.30" /> \begin{signline}And the mother of the child said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}liveth, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.

<ve /><v id="31" bcv="2KI.4.31" /> \begin{signline}And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="2KI.4.32" /> \begin{signline}And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}laid upon his bed.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="2KI.4.33" /> \begin{signline}He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="34" bcv="2KI.4.34" /> \begin{signline}And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="35" bcv="2KI.4.35" /> \begin{signline}Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="36" bcv="2KI.4.36" /> \begin{signline}And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="37" bcv="2KI.4.37" /> \begin{signline}Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="8" bcv="2KI.6.8" />\begin{signline}¶ Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}shall be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}my camp.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2KI.6.9" /> \begin{signline}And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.\end{signline}
