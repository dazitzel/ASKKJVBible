<ve /><v id="2" bcv="1SA.1.2" /> \begin{signline}And he had two wives; the name of the one\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="1SA.1.3" /> \begin{signline}And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline},\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}there.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="4" bcv="1SA.1.4" />\begin{signline}¶ And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="1SA.1.5" /> \begin{signline}But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}had shut up her womb.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="1SA.1.6" /> \begin{signline}And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}had shut up her womb.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="1SA.1.7" />\begin{signline}And\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="1SA.1.8" /> \begin{signline}Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not I better to thee than ten sons?\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="9" bcv="1SA.1.9" />\begin{signline}¶ So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="1SA.1.10" />\begin{signline}And she\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, and wept sore.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="1SA.1.11" /> \begin{signline}And she vowed a vow, and said, O\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="1SA.1.12" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, that Eli marked her mouth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="1SA.1.13" /> \begin{signline}Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought  she had been drunken.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="1SA.1.14" /> \begin{signline}And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="1SA.1.15" /> \begin{signline}And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="1SA.1.16" /> \begin{signline}Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="1SA.1.17" /> \begin{signline}Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thee\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy petition that thou hast asked of him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="1SA.1.18" /> \begin{signline}And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}sad\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="19" bcv="1SA.1.19" />\begin{signline}¶ And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}remembered her.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="1SA.1.20" /> \begin{signline}Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}saying\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, Because I have asked him of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="1SA.1.21" /> \begin{signline}And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="1SA.1.22" /> \begin{signline}But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}I will not go up\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}until the child be weaned, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}then\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}I will bring him, that he may appear before the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, and there abide for ever.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="1SA.1.23" /> \begin{signline}And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="7" bcv="1SA.3.7" /> \begin{signline}Now Samuel did not yet know the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, neither was the word of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}yet revealed unto him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="1SA.3.8" /> \begin{signline}And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}had called the child.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="1SA.3.9" /> \begin{signline}Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, \end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="1SA.3.10" /> \begin{signline}And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="11" bcv="1SA.3.11" />\begin{signline}¶ And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="1SA.3.12" /> \begin{signline}In that day I will perform against Eli all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}things\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="1SA.3.13" /> \begin{signline}For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="1SA.3.14" /> \begin{signline}And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="15" bcv="1SA.3.15" />\begin{signline}¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="1SA.3.16" /> \begin{signline}Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}I.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="20" bcv="1SA.3.20" /> \begin{signline}And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}established \end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a prophet of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}

<p><v id="1" bcv="1SA.4.1" /> \begin{signline}And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.\end{signline}

Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.\end{signline}

And they understood that the ark of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}was come into the camp.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="1SA.4.7" /> \begin{signline}And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="11" bcv="1SA.4.11" /> \begin{signline}And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="13" bcv="1SA.4.13" /> \begin{signline}And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God.

<ve /><v id="8" bcv="1SA.5.8" /> \begin{signline}They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?

<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="1SA.5.10" />\begin{signline}¶ Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="1SA.5.11" /> \begin{signline}So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="1SA.5.12" /> \begin{signline}And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.\end{signline}

And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.\end{signline}

And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="37" bcv="1SA.14.37" /> \begin{signline}And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="28" bcv="1SA.20.28" /> \begin{signline}And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}leave\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of me\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to go\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to Beth-lehem:\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="34" bcv="1SA.20.34" /> \begin{signline}So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="37" bcv="1SA.20.37" /> \begin{signline}And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not the arrow beyond thee?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="38" bcv="1SA.20.38" /> \begin{signline}And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="39" bcv="1SA.20.39" /> \begin{signline}But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="40" bcv="1SA.20.40" /> \begin{signline}And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to the city.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="42" bcv="1SA.20.42" /> \begin{signline}And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, saying, The\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.

<p><v id="1" bcv="1SA.21.1" /> \begin{signline}Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou alone, and no man with thee?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="1SA.21.2" /> \begin{signline}And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}my\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}servants to such and such a place.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="1SA.21.3" /> \begin{signline}Now therefore what is under thine hand? give\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}me\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}five\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}loaves of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}bread in mine hand, or what there is present.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="1SA.21.4" /> \begin{signline}And the priest answered David, and said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}There is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="1SA.21.5" /> \begin{signline}And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}have been\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}the bread is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="1SA.21.6" /> \begin{signline}So the priest gave him hallowed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}bread:\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="9" bcv="1SA.21.9" /> \begin{signline}And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is here\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it:\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}for\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no other save that here.

<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="1SA.21.10" />\begin{signline}¶ And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="1SA.21.11" /> \begin{signline}And the servants of Achish said unto him,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="11" bcv="1SA.22.11" /> \begin{signline}Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="13" bcv="1SA.22.13" /> \begin{signline}And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="1SA.22.14" /> \begin{signline}Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is so\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king’s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="2" bcv="1SA.24.2" /> \begin{signline}Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.\end{signline}

And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="1SA.24.17" /> \begin{signline}And he said to David, Thou\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="1SA.24.18" /> \begin{signline}And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="1SA.24.19" /> \begin{signline}For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="1SA.24.20" /> \begin{signline}And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.\end{signline}
