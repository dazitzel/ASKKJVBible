<ve /><v id="22" bcv="EPH.4.22" /> \begin{signline}That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="EPH.4.23" /> \begin{signline}And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="EPH.4.24" /> \begin{signline}And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="25" bcv="EPH.4.25" /> \begin{signline}Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="EPH.4.26" /> \begin{signline}Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="EPH.4.27" /> \begin{signline}Neither give place to the devil.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="EPH.4.28" /> \begin{signline}Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}his\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="EPH.4.29" /> \begin{signline}Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="EPH.4.30" /> \begin{signline}And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="EPH.4.31" /> \begin{signline}Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="EPH.4.32" /> \begin{signline}And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christâ€™s sake hath forgiven you.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="2" bcv="EPH.5.2" /> \begin{signline}And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="EPH.5.3" /> \begin{signline}But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="EPH.5.4" /> \begin{signline}Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="EPH.5.5" /> \begin{signline}For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="EPH.5.6" /> \begin{signline}Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="EPH.5.7" /> \begin{signline}Be not ye therefore partakers with them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="EPH.5.8" /> \begin{signline}For ye were sometimes darkness, but now\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are ye\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}light in the Lord: walk as children of light:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="EPH.5.9" />\begin{signline}(For the fruit of the Spirit\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="12" bcv="EPH.5.12" /> \begin{signline}For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="EPH.5.13" /> \begin{signline}But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="23" bcv="EPH.5.23" /> \begin{signline}For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="EPH.5.24" /> \begin{signline}Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}let\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the wives\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to their own husbands in every thing.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="EPH.5.25" /> \begin{signline}Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="EPH.5.26" /> \begin{signline}That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="28" bcv="EPH.5.28" /> \begin{signline}So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="EPH.5.29" /> \begin{signline}For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="EPH.5.30" /> \begin{signline}For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="EPH.5.31" /> \begin{signline}For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="EPH.5.32" /> \begin{signline}This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="EPH.5.33" /> \begin{signline}Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}see\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that she reverence\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}her\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}husband.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="6" bcv="EPH.6.6" /> \begin{signline}Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="9" bcv="EPH.6.9" /> \begin{signline}And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="EPH.6.10" /> \begin{signline}Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="13" bcv="EPH.6.13" /> \begin{signline}Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.\end{signline}
