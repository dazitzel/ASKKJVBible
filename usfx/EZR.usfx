<ve /><v id="2" bcv="EZR.4.2" /> \begin{signline}Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}do;\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="EZR.4.3" /> \begin{signline}But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.\end{signline}
