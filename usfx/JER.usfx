<ve /><v id="5" bcv="JER.38.5" /> \begin{signline}Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in your hand: for the king\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}he that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}can do\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}any\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thing against you.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="JER.38.6" /> \begin{signline}Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords.

<ve /><v id="10" bcv="JER.38.10" /> \begin{signline}Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="JER.38.11" /> \begin{signline}So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="JER.38.12" /> \begin{signline}And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}these\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="JER.38.13" /> \begin{signline}So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="15" bcv="JER.38.15" /> \begin{signline}Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="JER.38.16" /> \begin{signline}So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.\end{signline}
