<p><v id="1" bcv="DAN.1.1" /> \begin{signline}In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.\end{signline}
<!--7:13 currentProgress-->
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="DAN.1.2" /> \begin{signline}And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="3" bcv="DAN.1.3" />\begin{signline}¶ And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}certain\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="DAN.1.4" /> \begin{signline}Children in whom\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}had\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="DAN.1.5" /> \begin{signline}And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="DAN.1.6" /> \begin{signline}Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="DAN.1.7" /> \begin{signline}Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}the name\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="8" bcv="DAN.1.8" />\begin{signline}¶ But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="DAN.1.9" /> \begin{signline}Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="DAN.1.10" /> \begin{signline}And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of your sort? then shall ye make\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}me\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}endanger my head to the king.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="DAN.1.11" /> \begin{signline}Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="DAN.1.12" /> \begin{signline}Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="DAN.1.13" /> \begin{signline}Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="DAN.1.14" /> \begin{signline}So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="DAN.1.15" /> \begin{signline}And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="DAN.1.16" /> \begin{signline}Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="17" bcv="DAN.1.17" />\begin{signline}¶ As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="DAN.1.18" /> \begin{signline}Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="DAN.1.19" /> \begin{signline}And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="DAN.1.20" /> \begin{signline}And in all matters of wisdom\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}astrologers that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in all his realm.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="DAN.1.21" /> \begin{signline}And Daniel continued\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto the first year of king Cyrus.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="2" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="DAN.2.1" /> \begin{signline}And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="DAN.2.2" /> \begin{signline}Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="DAN.2.3" /> \begin{signline}And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="DAN.2.4" /> \begin{signline}Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="DAN.2.5" /> \begin{signline}The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="DAN.2.6" /> \begin{signline}But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="DAN.2.7" /> \begin{signline}They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="DAN.2.8" /> \begin{signline}The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="DAN.2.9" /> \begin{signline}But if ye will not make known unto me the dream,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is but\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="DAN.2.10" />\begin{signline}¶ The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no king, lord, nor ruler,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="DAN.2.11" />\begin{signline}And\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="DAN.2.12" /> \begin{signline}For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Babylon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="DAN.2.13" /> \begin{signline}And the decree went forth that the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="14" bcv="DAN.2.14" />\begin{signline}¶ Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Babylon:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="DAN.2.15" /> \begin{signline}He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the decree\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="DAN.2.16" /> \begin{signline}Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="DAN.2.17" /> \begin{signline}Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="DAN.2.18" /> \begin{signline}That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Babylon.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="19" bcv="DAN.2.19" />\begin{signline}¶ Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="DAN.2.20" /> \begin{signline}Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="DAN.2.21" /> \begin{signline}And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="DAN.2.22" /> \begin{signline}He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="DAN.2.23" /> \begin{signline}I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}now\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}made known unto us the king’s matter.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="24" bcv="DAN.2.24" />\begin{signline}¶ Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="DAN.2.25" /> \begin{signline}Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="DAN.2.26" /> \begin{signline}The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="DAN.2.27" /> \begin{signline}Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="DAN.2.28" /> \begin{signline}But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="DAN.2.29" /> \begin{signline}As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}into thy mind\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="DAN.2.30" /> \begin{signline}But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}any\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}wisdom that I have more than any living, but for\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}their\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="31" bcv="DAN.2.31" />\begin{signline}¶ Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}terrible.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="DAN.2.32" /> \begin{signline}This image’s head\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="DAN.2.33" /> \begin{signline}His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="34" bcv="DAN.2.34" /> \begin{signline}Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="35" bcv="DAN.2.35" /> \begin{signline}Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="36" bcv="DAN.2.36" />\begin{signline}¶ This\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="37" bcv="DAN.2.37" /> \begin{signline}Thou, O king,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="38" bcv="DAN.2.38" /> \begin{signline}And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}this head of gold.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="39" bcv="DAN.2.39" /> \begin{signline}And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="40" bcv="DAN.2.40" /> \begin{signline}And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}things:\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="41" bcv="DAN.2.41" /> \begin{signline}And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="42" bcv="DAN.2.42" />\begin{signline}And\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the toes of the feet\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}part of iron, and part of clay,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="43" bcv="DAN.2.43" /> \begin{signline}And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="44" bcv="DAN.2.44" /> \begin{signline}And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}but\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="45" bcv="DAN.2.45" /> \begin{signline}Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="46" bcv="DAN.2.46" />\begin{signline}¶ Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="47" bcv="DAN.2.47" /> \begin{signline}The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it is\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, that your God\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="48" bcv="DAN.2.48" /> \begin{signline}Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Babylon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="49" bcv="DAN.2.49" /> \begin{signline}Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}sat\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in the gate of the king.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="3" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="DAN.3.1" /> \begin{signline}Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}threescore cubits,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="DAN.3.2" /> \begin{signline}Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="DAN.3.3" /> \begin{signline}Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="DAN.3.4" /> \begin{signline}Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="DAN.3.5" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<add>\begin{signline}That\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="DAN.3.6" /> \begin{signline}And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="DAN.3.7" /> \begin{signline}Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="8" bcv="DAN.3.8" />\begin{signline}¶ Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="DAN.3.9" /> \begin{signline}They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="DAN.3.10" /> \begin{signline}Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="DAN.3.11" /> \begin{signline}And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="DAN.3.12" /> \begin{signline}There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="DAN.3.13" />\begin{signline}¶ Then Nebuchadnezzar in\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}his\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="DAN.3.14" /> \begin{signline}Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Is it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="DAN.3.15" /> \begin{signline}Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made;\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}well:\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="DAN.3.16" /> \begin{signline}Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not careful to answer thee in this matter.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="DAN.3.17" /> \begin{signline}If it be\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}us\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}out of thine hand, O king.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="31" bcv="DAN.5.31" /> \begin{signline}And Darius the Median took the kingdom,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}being\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}about threescore and two years old.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="6" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="DAN.6.1" /> \begin{signline}It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="DAN.6.2" /> \begin{signline}And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="DAN.6.3" /> \begin{signline}Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="4" bcv="DAN.6.4" />\begin{signline}¶ Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="DAN.6.5" /> \begin{signline}Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}against him concerning the law of his God.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="6" bcv="DAN.6.6" /> \begin{signline}Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="DAN.6.7" /> \begin{signline}All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="DAN.6.8" /> \begin{signline}Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="DAN.6.9" /> \begin{signline}Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="DAN.6.10" />\begin{signline}¶ Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="11" bcv="DAN.6.11" /> \begin{signline}Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="DAN.6.12" /> \begin{signline}Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}a petition\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="DAN.6.13" /> \begin{signline}Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="DAN.6.14" /> \begin{signline}Then the king, when he heard\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}these\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}words, was sore displeased with himself, and set\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}his\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="DAN.6.15" /> \begin{signline}Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="DAN.6.16" /> \begin{signline}Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}into the den of lions.\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Now\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="DAN.6.17" /> \begin{signline}And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="18" bcv="DAN.6.18" />\begin{signline}¶ Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="DAN.6.19" /> \begin{signline}Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="DAN.6.20" /> \begin{signline}And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel:\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="DAN.6.21" /> \begin{signline}Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="DAN.6.22" /> \begin{signline}My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="DAN.6.23" /> \begin{signline}Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="24" bcv="DAN.6.24" />\begin{signline}¶ And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="25" bcv="DAN.6.25" />\begin{signline}¶ Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="DAN.6.26" /> \begin{signline}I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}shall be even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto the end.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="DAN.6.27" /> \begin{signline}He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="DAN.6.28" /> \begin{signline}So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="7" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="DAN.7.1" /> \begin{signline}In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}told the sum of the matters.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="DAN.7.2" /> \begin{signline}Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="DAN.7.3" /> \begin{signline}And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="DAN.7.4" /> \begin{signline}The first\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="DAN.7.5" /> \begin{signline}And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it had\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="DAN.7.6" /> \begin{signline}After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="DAN.7.7" /> \begin{signline}After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}diverse from all the beasts that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}before it; and it had ten horns.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="DAN.7.8" /> \begin{signline}I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="9" bcv="DAN.7.9" />\begin{signline}¶ I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was like\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the fiery flame,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}his wheels\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}burning fire.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="DAN.7.10" /> \begin{signline}A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="DAN.7.11" /> \begin{signline}I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="DAN.7.12" /> \begin{signline}As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="DAN.7.13" /> \begin{signline}I saw in the night visions, and, behold,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}one\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="DAN.7.14" /> \begin{signline}And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}which shall not be destroyed.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="15" bcv="DAN.7.15" />\begin{signline}¶ I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}my\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}body, and the visions of my head troubled me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="DAN.7.16" /> \begin{signline}I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="DAN.7.17" /> \begin{signline}These great beasts, which are four,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}four kings,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}which\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}shall arise out of the earth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="DAN.7.18" /> \begin{signline}But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="DAN.7.19" /> \begin{signline}Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}iron, and his nails\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}brass;\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}which\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="DAN.7.20" /> \begin{signline}And of the ten horns that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in his head, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}more stout than his fellows.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="DAN.7.21" /> \begin{signline}I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="DAN.7.22" /> \begin{signline}Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="DAN.7.23" /> \begin{signline}Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="DAN.7.24" /> \begin{signline}And the ten horns out of this kingdom\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}ten kings\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="DAN.7.25" /> \begin{signline}And he shall speak\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}great\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="DAN.7.26" /> \begin{signline}But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto the end.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="DAN.7.27" /> \begin{signline}And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="DAN.7.28" /> \begin{signline}Hitherto\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="8" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="DAN.8.1" /> \begin{signline}In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even unto\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="DAN.8.2" /> \begin{signline}And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}at Shushan\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}in\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the palace, which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="DAN.8.3" /> \begin{signline}Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}two\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}horns: and the\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}two\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}horns\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}high; but one\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}higher than the other, and the higher came up last.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="DAN.8.4" /> \begin{signline}I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was there any\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="DAN.8.5" /> \begin{signline}And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}had\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a notable horn between his eyes.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="DAN.8.6" /> \begin{signline}And he came to the ram that had\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}two\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="DAN.8.7" /> \begin{signline}And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="DAN.8.8" /> \begin{signline}Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="DAN.8.9" /> \begin{signline}And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}land\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="DAN.8.10" /> \begin{signline}And it waxed great,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to the host of heaven; and it cast down\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}some\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="DAN.8.11" /> \begin{signline}Yea, he magnified\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}himself\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}sacrifice\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="DAN.8.12" /> \begin{signline}And an host was given\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}against the daily\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}sacrifice\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="DAN.8.13" />\begin{signline}¶ Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}saint\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}which spake, How long\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}shall be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the vision\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}concerning\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the daily\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}sacrifice\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?\end{signline}
