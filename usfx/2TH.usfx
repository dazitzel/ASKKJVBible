<ve /><v id="7" bcv="2TH.3.7" /> \begin{signline}For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2TH.3.8" /> \begin{signline}Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2TH.3.9" /> \begin{signline}Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2TH.3.10" /> \begin{signline}For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2TH.3.11" /> \begin{signline}For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2TH.3.12" /> \begin{signline}Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="2TH.3.13" /> \begin{signline}But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2TH.3.14" /> \begin{signline}And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2TH.3.15" /> \begin{signline}Yet count\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not as an enemy, but admonish\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}as a brother.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2TH.3.16" /> \begin{signline}Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with you all.\end{signline}
