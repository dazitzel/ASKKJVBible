<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="ESG.10.10" />\begin{signline}Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for all the Gentiles.\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="3" bcv="ESG.11.3" />\begin{signline}Who was a Jew, and dwelt in the city of Susa, a great man, being a servitor in the kingâ€™s court.\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="ESG.11.10" />\begin{signline}Then they cried unto God, and upon their cry, as it were from a little fountain, was made a great flood, even much water.\end{signline}

<p><v id="1" bcv="ESG.12.1" />\begin{signline}And Mardocheus took his rest in the court with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, and keepers of the palace.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="2" bcv="ESG.12.2" />\begin{signline}And he heard their devices, and searched out their purposes, and learned that they were about to lay hands upon Artexerxes the king; and so he certified the king of them.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="3" bcv="ESG.12.3" />\begin{signline}Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and after that they had confessed it, they were strangled.\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="3" bcv="ESG.13.3" />\begin{signline}Now when I asked my counsellors how this might be brought to pass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved for his constant good will and steadfast fidelity, and had the honour of the second place in the kingdom,\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="4" bcv="ESG.13.4" />\begin{signline}Declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the world there was scattered a certain malicious people, that had laws contrary to all nations, and continually despised the commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms, honourably intended by us cannot go forward.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="5" bcv="ESG.13.5" />\begin{signline}Seeing then we understand that this people alone is continually in opposition unto all men, differing in the strange manner of their laws, and evil affected to our state, working all the mischief they can that our kingdom may not be firmly established:\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="6" bcv="ESG.13.6" />\begin{signline}Therefore have we commanded, that all they that are signified in writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs, and is next unto us, shall all, with their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without all mercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:\end{signline}
