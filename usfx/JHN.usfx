<ve /></p><p><v id="6" bcv="JHN.1.6" />\begin{signline}¶ There was a man sent from God, whose name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}John.\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="15" bcv="JHN.1.15" />\begin{signline}¶ John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="JHN.1.16" /> \begin{signline}And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="19" bcv="JHN.1.19" />\begin{signline}¶ And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="JHN.1.20" /> \begin{signline}And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="JHN.1.21" /> \begin{signline}And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="JHN.1.22" /> \begin{signline}Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="JHN.1.23" /> \begin{signline}He said, I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="JHN.1.24" /> \begin{signline}And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="JHN.1.25" /> \begin{signline}And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="JHN.1.26" /> \begin{signline}John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="JHN.1.27" /> \begin{signline}He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="JHN.1.28" /> \begin{signline}These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="29" bcv="JHN.1.29" />\begin{signline}¶ The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="JHN.1.30" /> \begin{signline}This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="JHN.1.31" /> \begin{signline}And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="JHN.1.32" /> \begin{signline}And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="JHN.1.33" /> \begin{signline}And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="34" bcv="JHN.1.34" /> \begin{signline}And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="36" bcv="JHN.1.36" /> \begin{signline}And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="37" bcv="JHN.1.37" /> \begin{signline}And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="38" bcv="JHN.1.38" /> \begin{signline}Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}What seek ye?\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="39" bcv="JHN.1.39" /> \begin{signline}He saith unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Come and see.\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="40" bcv="JHN.1.40" /> \begin{signline}One of the two which heard John\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}speak\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="41" bcv="JHN.1.41" /> \begin{signline}He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="42" bcv="JHN.1.42" /> \begin{signline}And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}which is by interpretation, A stone.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="43" bcv="JHN.1.43" />\begin{signline}¶ The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Follow me.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="44" bcv="JHN.1.44" /> \begin{signline}Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="45" bcv="JHN.1.45" /> \begin{signline}Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="46" bcv="JHN.1.46" /> \begin{signline}And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="47" bcv="JHN.1.47" /> \begin{signline}Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="48" bcv="JHN.1.48" /> \begin{signline}Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="49" bcv="JHN.1.49" /> \begin{signline}Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="50" bcv="JHN.1.50" /> \begin{signline}Jesus answered and said unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="51" bcv="JHN.1.51" /> \begin{signline}And he saith unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /></p><c id="2" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="JHN.2.1" /> \begin{signline}And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="JHN.2.2" /> \begin{signline}And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="JHN.2.3" /> \begin{signline}And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="JHN.2.4" /> \begin{signline}Jesus saith unto her,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="JHN.2.5" /> \begin{signline}His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="JHN.2.6" /> \begin{signline}And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="JHN.2.7" /> \begin{signline}Jesus saith unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Fill the waterpots with water.\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}And they filled them up to the brim.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="JHN.2.8" /> \begin{signline}And he saith unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}And they bare\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="JHN.2.9" /> \begin{signline}When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="JHN.2.10" /> \begin{signline}And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse:\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}but\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou hast kept the good wine until now.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="JHN.2.11" /> \begin{signline}This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="12" bcv="JHN.2.12" />\begin{signline}¶ After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="JHN.2.13" />\begin{signline}¶ And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="JHN.2.14" /> \begin{signline}And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="JHN.2.15" /> \begin{signline}And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="JHN.2.16" /> \begin{signline}And said unto them that sold doves,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="JHN.2.17" /> \begin{signline}And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="18" bcv="JHN.2.18" />\begin{signline}¶ Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="JHN.2.19" /> \begin{signline}Jesus answered and said unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="JHN.2.20" /> \begin{signline}Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="JHN.2.21" /> \begin{signline}But he spake of the temple of his body.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="JHN.2.22" /> \begin{signline}When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="23" bcv="JHN.2.23" />\begin{signline}¶ Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}day\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="JHN.2.24" /> \begin{signline}But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline},\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="JHN.2.25" /> \begin{signline}And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="3" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="JHN.3.1" /> \begin{signline}There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="JHN.3.2" /> \begin{signline}The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="JHN.3.3" /> \begin{signline}Jesus answered and said unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="JHN.3.4" /> \begin{signline}Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="JHN.3.5" /> \begin{signline}Jesus answered,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="JHN.3.6" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="JHN.3.7" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="JHN.3.8" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="JHN.3.9" /> \begin{signline}Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="JHN.3.10" /> \begin{signline}Jesus answered and said unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="JHN.3.11" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="JHN.3.12" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}heavenly things?\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="JHN.3.13" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the Son of man which is in heaven.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /></p><p><v id="14" bcv="JHN.3.14" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj>\begin{signline}¶ And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="JHN.3.15" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /></p><p><v id="16" bcv="JHN.3.16" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj>\begin{signline}¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="JHN.3.17" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /></p><p><v id="18" bcv="JHN.3.18" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj>\begin{signline}¶ He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="JHN.3.19" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="JHN.3.20" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="JHN.3.21" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /></p><p><v id="22" bcv="JHN.3.22" />\begin{signline}¶ After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="23" bcv="JHN.3.23" />\begin{signline}¶ And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="JHN.3.24" /> \begin{signline}For John was not yet cast into prison.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="25" bcv="JHN.3.25" />\begin{signline}¶ Then there arose a question between\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}some\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="JHN.3.26" /> \begin{signline}And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}men\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}come to him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="JHN.3.27" /> \begin{signline}John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="JHN.3.28" /> \begin{signline}Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="JHN.3.29" /> \begin{signline}He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="JHN.3.30" /> \begin{signline}He must increase, but I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}must\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}decrease.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="JHN.3.31" /> \begin{signline}He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="JHN.3.32" /> \begin{signline}And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="35" bcv="JHN.3.35" /> \begin{signline}The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="8" bcv="JHN.18.8" /> \begin{signline}Jesus answered,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}I have told you that I am\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}he\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:\end{signline}</wj>

<ve /><v id="12" bcv="JHN.18.12" /> \begin{signline}Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="JHN.18.13" /> \begin{signline}And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="35" bcv="JHN.18.35" /> \begin{signline}Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="38" bcv="JHN.18.38" /> \begin{signline}Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}at all\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="7" bcv="JHN.19.7" /> \begin{signline}The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="9" bcv="JHN.19.9" /> \begin{signline}And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="JHN.19.10" /> \begin{signline}Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="JHN.19.11" /> \begin{signline}Jesus answered,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Thou couldest have no power\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}at all\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="JHN.19.12" /> \begin{signline}And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="JHN.19.13" />\begin{signline}¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="JHN.19.14" /> \begin{signline}And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="JHN.19.15" /> \begin{signline}But they cried out, Away with\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, away with\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, crucify him.

<ve /><v id="16" bcv="JHN.19.16" /> \begin{signline}Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}away.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="JHN.19.17" /> \begin{signline}And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}the place\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="JHN.19.18" /> \begin{signline}Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="20" bcv="JHN.19.20" /> \begin{signline}This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Greek,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Latin.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="JHN.19.21" /> \begin{signline}Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="JHN.19.22" /> \begin{signline}Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="24" bcv="JHN.19.24" /> \begin{signline}They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="25" bcv="JHN.19.25" />\begin{signline}¶ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}wife\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="JHN.19.26" /> \begin{signline}When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Woman, behold thy son!\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="JHN.19.27" /> \begin{signline}Then saith he to the disciple,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Behold thy mother!\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}home.\end{signline}</add>
<ve /></p><p><v id="28" bcv="JHN.19.28" />\begin{signline}¶ After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}I thirst.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="JHN.19.29" /> \begin{signline}Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}upon hyssop, and put\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to his mouth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="JHN.19.30" /> \begin{signline}When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}It is finished:\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="JHN.19.31" /> \begin{signline}The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}they might be taken away.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="JHN.19.32" /> \begin{signline}Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="26" bcv="JHN.20.26" />\begin{signline}¶ And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them:\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}then\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Peace\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto you.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="JHN.20.27" /> \begin{signline}Then saith he to Thomas,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="JHN.20.28" /> \begin{signline}And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="JHN.20.29" /> \begin{signline}Jesus saith unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}they that have not seen, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}yet\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}have believed.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /></p><p><v id="30" bcv="JHN.20.30" />\begin{signline}¶ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="JHN.20.31" /> \begin{signline}But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.\end{signline}

<p><v id="1" bcv="JHN.21.1" /> \begin{signline}After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}himself\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="JHN.21.2" /> \begin{signline}There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}sons\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="JHN.21.3" /> \begin{signline}Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="JHN.21.4" /> \begin{signline}But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="JHN.21.5" /> \begin{signline}Then Jesus saith unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Children, have ye any meat?\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}They answered him, No.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="JHN.21.6" /> \begin{signline}And he said unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="JHN.21.7" /> \begin{signline}Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord.

<ve /><v id="8" bcv="JHN.21.8" /> \begin{signline}And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="10" bcv="JHN.21.10" /> \begin{signline}Jesus saith unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="JHN.21.11" /> \begin{signline}Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="JHN.21.12" /> \begin{signline}Jesus saith unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Come\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}dine.\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="JHN.21.13" /> \begin{signline}Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="JHN.21.14" /> \begin{signline}This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="16" bcv="JHN.21.16" /> \begin{signline}He saith to him again the second time,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Simon,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}son\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Jonas, lovest thou me?\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.

<ve /><v id="17" bcv="JHN.21.17" /> \begin{signline}He saith unto him the third time,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Simon,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}son\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Jonas, lovest thou me?\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Feed my sheep.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="JHN.21.18" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thee\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}whither thou wouldest not.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="JHN.21.19" /> \begin{signline}This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Follow me.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="JHN.21.20" /> \begin{signline}Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="JHN.21.21" /> \begin{signline}Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}shall\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}this man\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}do\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="JHN.21.22" /> \begin{signline}Jesus saith unto him,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}If I will that he tarry till I come, what\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to thee? follow thou me.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="JHN.21.23" /> \begin{signline}Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to thee?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="JHN.21.24" /> \begin{signline}This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="JHN.21.25" /> \begin{signline}And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.\end{signline}
