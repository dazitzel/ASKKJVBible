<p><v id="1" bcv="LUK.1.1" /> \begin{signline}Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="LUK.1.2" /> \begin{signline}Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="LUK.1.3" /> \begin{signline}It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="LUK.1.4" /> \begin{signline}That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="5" bcv="LUK.1.5" />\begin{signline}¶ There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judæa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the daughters of Aaron, and her name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Elisabeth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="LUK.1.6" /> \begin{signline}And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="LUK.1.7" /> \begin{signline}And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}now\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}well stricken in years.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="LUK.1.8" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="LUK.1.9" /> \begin{signline}According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="LUK.1.10" /> \begin{signline}And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="LUK.1.11" /> \begin{signline}And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="LUK.1.12" /> \begin{signline}And when Zacharias saw\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="LUK.1.13" /> \begin{signline}But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="LUK.1.14" /> \begin{signline}And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="LUK.1.15" /> \begin{signline}For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="LUK.1.16" /> \begin{signline}And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="LUK.1.17" /> \begin{signline}And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="LUK.1.18" /> \begin{signline}And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="LUK.1.19" /> \begin{signline}And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="LUK.1.20" /> \begin{signline}And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="LUK.1.21" /> \begin{signline}And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="LUK.1.22" /> \begin{signline}And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="LUK.1.23" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="LUK.1.24" /> \begin{signline}And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="LUK.1.25" /> \begin{signline}Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}me\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, to take away my reproach among men.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="LUK.1.26" /> \begin{signline}And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="LUK.1.27" /> \begin{signline}To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Mary.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="LUK.1.28" /> \begin{signline}And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thou that art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}highly favoured, the Lord\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with thee: blessed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou among women.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="LUK.1.29" /> \begin{signline}And when she saw\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="LUK.1.30" /> \begin{signline}And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="LUK.1.31" /> \begin{signline}And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="LUK.1.32" /> \begin{signline}He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="LUK.1.33" /> \begin{signline}And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="34" bcv="LUK.1.34" /> \begin{signline}Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="35" bcv="LUK.1.35" /> \begin{signline}And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="36" bcv="LUK.1.36" /> \begin{signline}And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="37" bcv="LUK.1.37" /> \begin{signline}For with God nothing shall be impossible.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="38" bcv="LUK.1.38" /> \begin{signline}And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="39" bcv="LUK.1.39" /> \begin{signline}And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="40" bcv="LUK.1.40" /> \begin{signline}And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="41" bcv="LUK.1.41" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="42" bcv="LUK.1.42" /> \begin{signline}And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou among women, and blessed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the fruit of thy womb.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="43" bcv="LUK.1.43" /> \begin{signline}And whence\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="44" bcv="LUK.1.44" /> \begin{signline}For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="45" bcv="LUK.1.45" /> \begin{signline}And blessed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="46" bcv="LUK.1.46" /> \begin{signline}And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="47" bcv="LUK.1.47" /> \begin{signline}And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="48" bcv="LUK.1.48" /> \begin{signline}For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="49" bcv="LUK.1.49" /> \begin{signline}For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}his name.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="50" bcv="LUK.1.50" /> \begin{signline}And his mercy\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}on them that fear him from generation to generation.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="51" bcv="LUK.1.51" /> \begin{signline}He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="52" bcv="LUK.1.52" /> \begin{signline}He hath put down the mighty from\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}their\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}seats, and exalted them of low degree.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="53" bcv="LUK.1.53" /> \begin{signline}He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="54" bcv="LUK.1.54" /> \begin{signline}He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}his\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}mercy;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="55" bcv="LUK.1.55" /> \begin{signline}As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="56" bcv="LUK.1.56" /> \begin{signline}And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="57" bcv="LUK.1.57" /> \begin{signline}Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="58" bcv="LUK.1.58" /> \begin{signline}And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="59" bcv="LUK.1.59" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="60" bcv="LUK.1.60" /> \begin{signline}And his mother answered and said, Not\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}; but he shall be called John.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="61" bcv="LUK.1.61" /> \begin{signline}And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="62" bcv="LUK.1.62" /> \begin{signline}And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="63" bcv="LUK.1.63" /> \begin{signline}And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="64" bcv="LUK.1.64" /> \begin{signline}And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}loosed\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and he spake, and praised God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="65" bcv="LUK.1.65" /> \begin{signline}And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="66" bcv="LUK.1.66" /> \begin{signline}And all they that heard\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}laid\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="67" bcv="LUK.1.67" /> \begin{signline}And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="68" bcv="LUK.1.68" /> \begin{signline}Blessed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="69" bcv="LUK.1.69" /> \begin{signline}And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="70" bcv="LUK.1.70" /> \begin{signline}As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="71" bcv="LUK.1.71" /> \begin{signline}That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="72" bcv="LUK.1.72" /> \begin{signline}To perform the mercy\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}promised\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="73" bcv="LUK.1.73" /> \begin{signline}The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="74" bcv="LUK.1.74" /> \begin{signline}That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="75" bcv="LUK.1.75" /> \begin{signline}In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="76" bcv="LUK.1.76" /> \begin{signline}And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="77" bcv="LUK.1.77" /> \begin{signline}To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="78" bcv="LUK.1.78" /> \begin{signline}Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="79" bcv="LUK.1.79" /> \begin{signline}To give light to them that sit in darkness and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}in\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="80" bcv="LUK.1.80" /> \begin{signline}And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="2" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="LUK.2.1" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="LUK.2.2" />\begin{signline}(\end{signline}<add>\begin{signline}And\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="LUK.2.3" /> \begin{signline}And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="LUK.2.4" /> \begin{signline}And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="LUK.2.5" /> \begin{signline}To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="LUK.2.6" /> \begin{signline}And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="LUK.2.7" /> \begin{signline}And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="LUK.2.8" /> \begin{signline}And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="LUK.2.9" /> \begin{signline}And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="LUK.2.10" /> \begin{signline}And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="LUK.2.11" /> \begin{signline}For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="LUK.2.12" /> \begin{signline}And this\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}shall be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="LUK.2.13" /> \begin{signline}And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="LUK.2.14" /> \begin{signline}Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="LUK.2.15" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="LUK.2.16" /> \begin{signline}And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="LUK.2.17" /> \begin{signline}And when they had seen\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="LUK.2.18" /> \begin{signline}And all they that heard\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="LUK.2.19" /> \begin{signline}But Mary kept all these things, and pondered\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in her heart.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="LUK.2.20" /> \begin{signline}And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="LUK.2.21" /> \begin{signline}And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="LUK.2.22" /> \begin{signline}And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to the Lord;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="LUK.2.23" />\begin{signline}(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="LUK.2.24" /> \begin{signline}And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="LUK.2.25" /> \begin{signline}And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Simeon; and the same man\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="LUK.2.26" /> \begin{signline}And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="LUK.2.27" /> \begin{signline}And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="LUK.2.28" /> \begin{signline}Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="LUK.2.29" /> \begin{signline}Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="LUK.2.30" /> \begin{signline}For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="LUK.2.31" /> \begin{signline}Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="LUK.2.32" /> \begin{signline}A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="LUK.2.33" /> \begin{signline}And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="34" bcv="LUK.2.34" /> \begin{signline}And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}child\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="35" bcv="LUK.2.35" />\begin{signline}(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="36" bcv="LUK.2.36" /> \begin{signline}And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="37" bcv="LUK.2.37" /> \begin{signline}And she\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}God\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with fastings and prayers night and day.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="38" bcv="LUK.2.38" /> \begin{signline}And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="39" bcv="LUK.2.39" /> \begin{signline}And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="40" bcv="LUK.2.40" /> \begin{signline}And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="40" bcv="LUK.23.40" /> \begin{signline}But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="41" bcv="LUK.23.41" /> \begin{signline}And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="4" bcv="LUK.24.4" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="14" bcv="LUK.24.14" /> \begin{signline}And they talked together of all these things which had happened.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="16" bcv="LUK.24.16" /> \begin{signline}But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="18" bcv="LUK.24.18" /> \begin{signline}And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="LUK.24.19" /> \begin{signline}And he said unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}What things?\end{signline}</wj> \begin{signline}And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="23" bcv="LUK.24.23" /> \begin{signline}And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="LUK.24.24" /> \begin{signline}And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="LUK.24.25" /> \begin{signline}Then he said unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="LUK.24.26" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="LUK.24.27" /> \begin{signline}And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="LUK.24.28" /> \begin{signline}And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="LUK.24.29" /> \begin{signline}But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="LUK.24.30" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and brake, and gave to them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="LUK.24.31" /> \begin{signline}And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="LUK.24.32" /> \begin{signline}And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="LUK.24.33" /> \begin{signline}And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="34" bcv="LUK.24.34" /> \begin{signline}Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="35" bcv="LUK.24.35" /> \begin{signline}And they told what things\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were done\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="36" bcv="LUK.24.36" />\begin{signline}¶ And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Peace\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto you.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="37" bcv="LUK.24.37" /> \begin{signline}But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="39" bcv="LUK.24.39" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<wj> \begin{signline}Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="40" bcv="LUK.24.40" /> \begin{signline}And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}his\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}hands and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}his\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}feet.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="41" bcv="LUK.24.41" /> \begin{signline}And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}Have ye here any meat?\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="42" bcv="LUK.24.42" /> \begin{signline}And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="43" bcv="LUK.24.43" /> \begin{signline}And he took\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and did eat before them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="44" bcv="LUK.24.44" /> \begin{signline}And he said unto them,\end{signline} <wj> \begin{signline}These\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}in\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the prophets, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}in\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the psalms, concerning me.\end{signline}</wj>
<ve /><v id="45" bcv="LUK.24.45" /> \begin{signline}Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,\end{signline}
