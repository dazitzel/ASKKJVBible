<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2SA.1.2" /> \begin{signline}It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2SA.1.3" /> \begin{signline}And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2SA.1.4" /> \begin{signline}And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="2SA.1.5" /> \begin{signline}And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="2SA.1.6" /> \begin{signline}And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="2SA.1.7" /> \begin{signline}And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}I.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2SA.1.8" /> \begin{signline}And he said unto me, Who\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou? And I answered him, I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}an Amalekite.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2SA.1.9" /> \begin{signline}He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}yet whole in me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2SA.1.10" /> \begin{signline}So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}upon his head, and the bracelet that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="11" bcv="2SA.1.11" /> \begin{signline}Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with him:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2SA.1.12" /> \begin{signline}And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="2SA.1.13" />\begin{signline}¶ And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou? And he answered, I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2SA.1.14" /> \begin{signline}And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD’s\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}anointed?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2SA.1.15" /> \begin{signline}And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2SA.1.16" /> \begin{signline}And David said unto him, Thy blood\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD’s\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}anointed.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="17" bcv="2SA.1.17" />\begin{signline}¶ And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2SA.1.18" />\begin{signline}(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}the use of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the bow: behold,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}written in the book of Jasher.)\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="2SA.1.19" /> \begin{signline}The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="2SA.1.20" /> \begin{signline}Tell\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not in Gath, publish\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="2SA.1.21" /> \begin{signline}Ye mountains of Gilboa,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}let there be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no dew, neither\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}let there be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as though he had\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}been\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}anointed with oil.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="2SA.1.22" /> \begin{signline}From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="2SA.1.23" /> \begin{signline}Saul and Jonathan\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="2SA.1.24" /> \begin{signline}Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}other\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="2SA.1.25" /> \begin{signline}How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thou wast\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}slain in thine high places.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="2SA.1.26" /> \begin{signline}I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="2SA.1.27" /> \begin{signline}How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="2" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="2SA.2.1" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2SA.2.2" /> \begin{signline}So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2SA.2.3" /> \begin{signline}And his men that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2SA.2.4" /> \begin{signline}And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}That\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the men of Jabesh-gilead\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were they\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that buried Saul.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="5" bcv="2SA.2.5" />\begin{signline}¶ And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}ye of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto Saul, and have buried him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="2SA.2.6" /> \begin{signline}And now the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="2SA.2.7" /> \begin{signline}Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="8" bcv="2SA.2.8" />\begin{signline}¶ But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2SA.2.9" /> \begin{signline}And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2SA.2.10" /> \begin{signline}Ish-bosheth Saul’s son\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2SA.2.11" /> \begin{signline}And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="12" bcv="2SA.2.12" />\begin{signline}¶ And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="2SA.2.13" /> \begin{signline}And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2SA.2.14" /> \begin{signline}And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2SA.2.15" /> \begin{signline}Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}pertained\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2SA.2.16" /> \begin{signline}And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thrust\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in Gibeon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="2SA.2.17" /> \begin{signline}And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="18" bcv="2SA.2.18" />\begin{signline}¶ And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}light of foot as a wild roe.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="2SA.2.19" /> \begin{signline}And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="2SA.2.20" /> \begin{signline}Then Abner looked behind him, and said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou Asahel? And he answered, I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="2SA.2.21" /> \begin{signline}And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="2SA.2.22" /> \begin{signline}And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="2SA.2.23" /> \begin{signline}Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}rib\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="2SA.2.24" /> \begin{signline}Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}lieth\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="25" bcv="2SA.2.25" />\begin{signline}¶ And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="2SA.2.26" /> \begin{signline}Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="2SA.2.27" /> \begin{signline}And Joab said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="2SA.2.28" /> \begin{signline}So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="2SA.2.29" /> \begin{signline}And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="2SA.2.30" /> \begin{signline}And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="2SA.2.31" /> \begin{signline}But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}three hundred and threescore men died.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="32" bcv="2SA.2.32" />\begin{signline}¶ And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was in\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="3" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="2SA.3.1" /> \begin{signline}Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="2" bcv="2SA.3.2" />\begin{signline}¶ And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2SA.3.3" /> \begin{signline}And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2SA.3.4" /> \begin{signline}And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="2SA.3.5" /> \begin{signline}And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="6" bcv="2SA.3.6" />\begin{signline}¶ And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="7" bcv="2SA.3.7" /> \begin{signline}And Saul had a concubine, whose name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Ish-bosheth\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2SA.3.8" /> \begin{signline}Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}I a dog’s head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2SA.3.9" /> \begin{signline}So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2SA.3.10" /> \begin{signline}To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2SA.3.11" /> \begin{signline}And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="12" bcv="2SA.3.12" />\begin{signline}¶ And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the land? saying\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}also\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}shall be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="2SA.3.13" />\begin{signline}¶ And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2SA.3.14" /> \begin{signline}And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}me\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2SA.3.15" /> \begin{signline}And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}her\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}husband,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}from Phaltiel the son of Laish.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2SA.3.16" /> \begin{signline}And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="17" bcv="2SA.3.17" />\begin{signline}¶ And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}king over you:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2SA.3.18" /> \begin{signline}Now then do\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it:\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}for the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="2SA.3.19" /> \begin{signline}And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="2SA.3.20" /> \begin{signline}So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with him a feast.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="2SA.3.21" /> \begin{signline}And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="22" bcv="2SA.3.22" />\begin{signline}¶ And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}pursuing\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="2SA.3.23" /> \begin{signline}When Joab and all the host that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="2SA.3.24" /> \begin{signline}Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}it\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="2SA.3.25" /> \begin{signline}Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2SA.11.4" /> \begin{signline}And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="2SA.11.5" /> \begin{signline}And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with child.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="6" bcv="2SA.11.6" />\begin{signline}¶ And David sent to Joab,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}saying\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="2SA.11.7" /> \begin{signline}And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded \end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2SA.11.8" /> \begin{signline}And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of meat\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}from the king.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2SA.11.9" /> \begin{signline}But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2SA.11.10" /> \begin{signline}And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thy\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}journey? why\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}then\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}didst thou not go down unto thine house?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2SA.11.11" /> \begin{signline}And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou livest, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2SA.11.12" /> \begin{signline}And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="2SA.11.13" /> \begin{signline}And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="14" bcv="2SA.11.14" />\begin{signline}¶ And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}by the hand of Uriah.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2SA.11.15" /> \begin{signline}And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2SA.11.16" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="2SA.11.17" /> \begin{signline}And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}some\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="18" bcv="2SA.11.18" />\begin{signline}¶ Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="2SA.11.19" /> \begin{signline}And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="2SA.11.20" /> \begin{signline}And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="2SA.11.21" /> \begin{signline}Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="22" bcv="2SA.11.22" />\begin{signline}¶ So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="2SA.11.23" /> \begin{signline}And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="2SA.11.24" /> \begin{signline}And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}some\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="2SA.11.25" /> \begin{signline}Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="26" bcv="2SA.11.26" />\begin{signline}¶ And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="2SA.11.27" /> \begin{signline}And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="12" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="2SA.12.1" /> \begin{signline}And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2SA.12.2" /> \begin{signline}The rich\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}man\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}had exceeding many flocks and herds:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2SA.12.3" /> \begin{signline}But the poor\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}man\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2SA.12.4" /> \begin{signline}And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="2SA.12.5" /> \begin{signline}And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}liveth, the man that hath done this\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thing\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}shall surely die:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="2SA.12.6" /> \begin{signline}And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="7" bcv="2SA.12.7" />\begin{signline}¶ And Nathan said to David, Thou\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the man. Thus saith the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2SA.12.8" /> \begin{signline}And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that had been\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2SA.12.9" /> \begin{signline}Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to be\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2SA.12.10" /> \begin{signline}Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2SA.12.11" /> \begin{signline}Thus saith the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2SA.12.12" /> \begin{signline}For thou didst\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="2SA.12.13" /> \begin{signline}And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}. And Nathan said unto David, The\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2SA.12.14" /> \begin{signline}Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}to blaspheme, the child also\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}born unto thee shall surely die.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="15" bcv="2SA.12.15" />\begin{signline}¶ And Nathan departed unto his house. And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2SA.12.16" /> \begin{signline}David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="2SA.12.17" /> \begin{signline}And the elders of his house arose,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and went\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2SA.12.18" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="2SA.12.19" /> \begin{signline}But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="2SA.12.20" /> \begin{signline}Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}himself\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="2SA.12.21" /> \begin{signline}Then said his servants unto him, What thing\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}while it was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="2SA.12.22" /> \begin{signline}And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}whether\end{signline}</add>  \begin{signline}\end{signline}<nd>\begin{signline}GOD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}will be gracious to me, that the child may live?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="2SA.12.23" /> \begin{signline}But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="24" bcv="2SA.12.24" />\begin{signline}¶ And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}loved him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="2SA.12.25" /> \begin{signline}And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="26" bcv="2SA.12.26" />\begin{signline}¶ And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="2SA.12.27" /> \begin{signline}And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="2SA.12.28" /> \begin{signline}Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="2SA.12.29" /> \begin{signline}And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="2SA.12.30" /> \begin{signline}And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}set\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="2SA.12.31" /> \begin{signline}And he brought forth the people that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}therein, and put\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="13" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="2SA.13.1" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2SA.13.2" /> \begin{signline}And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2SA.13.3" /> \begin{signline}But Amnon had a friend, whose name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a very subtil man.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2SA.13.4" /> \begin{signline}And he said unto him, Why\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}being\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the king’s son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="2SA.13.5" /> \begin{signline}And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and eat\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}at her hand.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="6" bcv="2SA.13.6" />\begin{signline}¶ So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="2SA.13.7" /> \begin{signline}Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2SA.13.8" /> \begin{signline}So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2SA.13.9" /> \begin{signline}And she took a pan, and poured\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2SA.13.10" /> \begin{signline}And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}into the chamber to Amnon her brother.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2SA.13.11" /> \begin{signline}And when she had brought\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2SA.13.12" /> \begin{signline}And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="2SA.13.13" /> \begin{signline}And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2SA.13.14" /> \begin{signline}Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="15" bcv="2SA.13.15" />\begin{signline}¶ Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2SA.13.16" /> \begin{signline}And she said unto him,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}There is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no cause: this evil in sending me away\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="2SA.13.17" /> \begin{signline}Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}woman\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}out from me, and bolt the door after her.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2SA.13.18" />\begin{signline}And\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}she had\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="19" bcv="2SA.13.19" />\begin{signline}¶ And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="2SA.13.20" /> \begin{signline}And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="21" bcv="2SA.13.21" />\begin{signline}¶ But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="2SA.13.22" /> \begin{signline}And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="23" bcv="2SA.13.23" />\begin{signline}¶ And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="2SA.13.24" /> \begin{signline}And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="2SA.13.25" /> \begin{signline}And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="2SA.13.26" /> \begin{signline}Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="2SA.13.27" /> \begin{signline}But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="29" bcv="2SA.13.29" /> \begin{signline}And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="30" bcv="2SA.13.30" />\begin{signline}¶ And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="2SA.13.31" /> \begin{signline}Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="2SA.13.32" /> \begin{signline}And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="2SA.13.33" /> \begin{signline}Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="34" bcv="2SA.13.34" /> \begin{signline}But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="35" bcv="2SA.13.35" /> \begin{signline}And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="36" bcv="2SA.13.36" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2SA.14.2" /> \begin{signline}And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2SA.14.3" /> \begin{signline}And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="13" bcv="2SA.14.13" /> \begin{signline}And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2SA.14.14" /> \begin{signline}For we must needs die, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}any\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2SA.14.15" /> \begin{signline}Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2SA.14.16" /> \begin{signline}For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that would\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="2SA.14.17" /> \begin{signline}Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}thy God will be with thee.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2SA.14.18" /> \begin{signline}Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="2SA.14.19" /> \begin{signline}And the king said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}Is not\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="2SA.14.20" /> \begin{signline}To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}things\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in the earth.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="21" bcv="2SA.14.21" />\begin{signline}¶ And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="2SA.14.22" /> \begin{signline}And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="2SA.14.23" /> \begin{signline}So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="2SA.14.24" /> \begin{signline}And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="25" bcv="2SA.14.25" />\begin{signline}¶ But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised  as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="2SA.14.26" /> \begin{signline}And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it:\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}because\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}the hair\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="2SA.14.27" /> \begin{signline}And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="28" bcv="2SA.14.28" />\begin{signline}¶ So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="2SA.14.29" /> \begin{signline}Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="2SA.14.30" /> \begin{signline}Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="2SA.14.31" /> \begin{signline}Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}his\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="2SA.14.32" /> \begin{signline}And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur?\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it had been\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}good for me\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to have been\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}any\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}iniquity in me, let him kill me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="33" bcv="2SA.14.33" /> \begin{signline}So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="15" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="2SA.15.1" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2SA.15.2" /> \begin{signline}And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called  unto him, and said, Of what city\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thou? And he said, Thy servant\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of one of the tribes of Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2SA.15.3" /> \begin{signline}And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}good and right; but\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no man\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}deputed\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the king to hear thee.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2SA.15.4" /> \begin{signline}Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="2SA.15.5" />\begin{signline}And it was\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, that when any man came nigh\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to him\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="2SA.15.6" /> \begin{signline}And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="7" bcv="2SA.15.7" />\begin{signline}¶ And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, in Hebron.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="2SA.15.8" /> \begin{signline}For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="2SA.15.9" /> \begin{signline}And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="2SA.15.10" />\begin{signline}¶ But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2SA.15.11" /> \begin{signline}And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2SA.15.12" /> \begin{signline}And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2SA.15.14" /> \begin{signline}And David said unto all his servants that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}else\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="2SA.15.15" /> \begin{signline}And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are ready to do\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="2SA.15.16" /> \begin{signline}And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}which were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}concubines, to keep the house.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="2SA.15.17" /> \begin{signline}And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="2SA.15.18" /> \begin{signline}And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="21" bcv="2SA.15.21" /> \begin{signline}And Ittai answered the king, and said,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}As\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}liveth, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="2SA.15.22" /> \begin{signline}And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with him.\end{signline}

And when they had sought and could not find\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, they returned to Jerusalem.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="2SA.17.21" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="2" bcv="2SA.18.2" /> \begin{signline}And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="2SA.18.3" /> \begin{signline}But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thou art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}worth ten thousand of us: therefore now\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}better that thou succour us out of the city.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="2SA.18.4" /> \begin{signline}And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.\end{signline}

And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}under him went away.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="2SA.18.10" /> \begin{signline}And a certain man saw\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="2SA.18.11" /> \begin{signline}And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}him\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}shekels\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of silver, and a girdle.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="2SA.18.12" /> \begin{signline}And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}shekels\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of silver in mine hand,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}yet\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}touch\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the young man Absalom.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="2SA.18.13" /> \begin{signline}Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}me\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="2SA.18.14" /> \begin{signline}Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee.
