<ve /><v id="13" bcv="COL.2.13" /> \begin{signline}And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="COL.2.14" /> \begin{signline}Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="COL.2.15" /> \begin{signline}\end{signline}<add>\begin{signline}And\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.\end{signline}

<ve /></p><p><v id="5" bcv="COL.3.5" /> \begin{signline}Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="COL.3.6" /> \begin{signline}For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:\end{signline}
