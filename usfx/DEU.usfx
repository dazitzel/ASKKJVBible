<ve /><v id="34" bcv="DEU.1.34" /> \begin{signline}And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="35" bcv="DEU.1.35" /> \begin{signline}Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="37" bcv="DEU.1.37" /> \begin{signline}Also the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="40" bcv="DEU.1.40" />\begin{signline}But\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}as for\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="41" bcv="DEU.1.41" /> \begin{signline}Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, we will go up and fight, according to all that the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}our God commanded  us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="42" bcv="DEU.1.42" /> \begin{signline}And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}am\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="43" bcv="DEU.1.43" /> \begin{signline}So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}, and went presumptuously up into the hill.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="44" bcv="DEU.1.44" /> \begin{signline}And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}even\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto Hormah.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="45" bcv="DEU.1.45" /> \begin{signline}And ye returned and wept before the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd>\begin{signline}; but the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="46" bcv="DEU.1.46" /> \begin{signline}So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}

<p><v id="1" bcv="DEU.2.1" /> \begin{signline}Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="DEU.2.2" /> \begin{signline}And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}spake unto me, saying,\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="4" bcv="DEU.2.4" /> \begin{signline}And command thou the people, saying, Ye\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="DEU.2.5" /> \begin{signline}Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}for\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a possession.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="DEU.2.6" /> \begin{signline}Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="DEU.2.7" /> \begin{signline}For the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}thy God\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}hath been\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="9" bcv="DEU.2.9" /> \begin{signline}And the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}for\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}for\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}a possession.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="12" bcv="DEU.2.12" /> \begin{signline}The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}gave unto them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="DEU.2.13" /> \begin{signline}Now rise up,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}said I\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.\end{signline}
