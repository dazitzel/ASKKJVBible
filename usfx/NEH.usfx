<p><v id="1" bcv="NEH.1.1" /> \begin{signline}The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="NEH.1.2" /> \begin{signline}That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}certain\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="NEH.1.3" /> \begin{signline}And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="4" bcv="NEH.1.4" />\begin{signline}¶ And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}certain\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="5" bcv="NEH.1.5" /> \begin{signline}And said, I beseech thee, O\end{signline} <nd>\begin{signline}LORD\end{signline}</nd> \begin{signline}God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="NEH.1.6" /> \begin{signline}Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father’s house have sinned.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="NEH.1.7" /> \begin{signline}We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="NEH.1.8" /> \begin{signline}Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}If\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="NEH.1.9" />\begin{signline}But\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}if\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}yet\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="NEH.1.10" />\begin{signline}Now these\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="NEH.1.11" /> \begin{signline}O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="2" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="NEH.2.1" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}wine\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}before him: and I took up the wine, and gave\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto the king. Now I had not been\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}beforetime\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}sad in his presence.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="NEH.2.2" /> \begin{signline}Wherefore the king said unto me, Why\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thy countenance sad, seeing thou\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}art\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}not sick? this\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}nothing\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}else\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="NEH.2.3" /> \begin{signline}And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}lieth\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="NEH.2.4" /> \begin{signline}Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="NEH.2.5" /> \begin{signline}And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="NEH.2.6" /> \begin{signline}And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="NEH.2.7" /> \begin{signline}Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="NEH.2.8" /> \begin{signline}And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}appertained\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted  me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="9" bcv="NEH.2.9" />\begin{signline}¶ Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="NEH.2.10" /> \begin{signline}When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="NEH.2.11" /> \begin{signline}So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="12" bcv="NEH.2.12" />\begin{signline}¶ And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}any\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was there any\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="NEH.2.13" /> \begin{signline}And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="NEH.2.14" /> \begin{signline}Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}no place for the beast\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}under me to pass.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="NEH.2.15" /> \begin{signline}Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}returned.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="NEH.2.16" /> \begin{signline}And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="17" bcv="NEH.2.17" />\begin{signline}¶ Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}are\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in, how Jerusalem\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}lieth\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="NEH.2.18" /> \begin{signline}Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}this\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}good\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}work\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="NEH.2.19" /> \begin{signline}But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}it\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="NEH.2.20" /> \begin{signline}Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="3" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="NEH.3.1" /> \begin{signline}Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="NEH.3.2" /> \begin{signline}And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="NEH.3.3" /> \begin{signline}But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}also\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="NEH.3.4" /> \begin{signline}And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="NEH.3.5" /> \begin{signline}And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="NEH.3.6" /> \begin{signline}Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="NEH.3.7" /> \begin{signline}And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="NEH.3.8" /> \begin{signline}Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}one of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="NEH.3.9" /> \begin{signline}And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="NEH.3.10" /> \begin{signline}And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="NEH.3.11" /> \begin{signline}Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="NEH.3.12" /> \begin{signline}And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="NEH.3.13" /> \begin{signline}The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="NEH.3.14" /> \begin{signline}But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Beth-haccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="NEH.3.15" /> \begin{signline}But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king’s garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="NEH.3.16" /> \begin{signline}After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth-zur, unto\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}the place\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="NEH.3.17" /> \begin{signline}After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="19" bcv="NEH.3.19" /> \begin{signline}And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of the wall\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="NEH.3.20" /> \begin{signline}After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}of the wall\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="NEH.3.21" /> \begin{signline}After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="NEH.3.22" /> \begin{signline}And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.\end{signline}

After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="NEH.3.26" /> \begin{signline}Moreover the Nethinims dwelt  in Ophel, unto\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}the place\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="NEH.3.27" /> \begin{signline}After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="NEH.3.28" /> \begin{signline}From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="NEH.3.29" /> \begin{signline}After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="31" bcv="NEH.3.31" /> \begin{signline}After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith’s son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="32" bcv="NEH.3.32" /> \begin{signline}And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="4" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="NEH.4.1" /> \begin{signline}But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="NEH.4.2" /> \begin{signline}And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="NEH.4.3" /> \begin{signline}Now Tobiah the Ammonite\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="4" bcv="NEH.4.4" /> \begin{signline}Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="NEH.4.5" /> \begin{signline}And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}thee\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to anger before the builders.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="NEH.4.6" /> \begin{signline}So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="7" bcv="NEH.4.7" />\begin{signline}¶ But it came to pass,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth, \end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="NEH.4.8" /> \begin{signline}And conspired all of them together to come\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="NEH.4.9" /> \begin{signline}Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="10" bcv="NEH.4.10" /> \begin{signline}And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="NEH.4.11" /> \begin{signline}And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="NEH.4.12" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}they will be upon you\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="13" bcv="NEH.4.13" />\begin{signline}¶ Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="NEH.4.14" /> \begin{signline}And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember  the Lord,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}which is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="15" bcv="NEH.4.15" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="16" bcv="NEH.4.16" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass from that time forth,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}behind all the house of Judah.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="NEH.4.17" /> \begin{signline}They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}every one\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}hand\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}held a weapon.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="NEH.4.18" /> \begin{signline}For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}builded. And he that sounded the trumpet\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}by me.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="19" bcv="NEH.4.19" />\begin{signline}¶ And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="NEH.4.20" /> \begin{signline}In what place\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}therefore\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="NEH.4.21" /> \begin{signline}So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="NEH.4.22" /> \begin{signline}Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge  within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="23" bcv="NEH.4.23" /> \begin{signline}So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}saving that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}every one put them off for washing.\end{signline}

<ve /><v id="40" bcv="NEH.12.40" /> \begin{signline}So stood the two\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}companies of them that gave\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="41" bcv="NEH.12.41" /> \begin{signline}And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Hananiah, with trumpets;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="42" bcv="NEH.12.42" /> \begin{signline}And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}their\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}overseer.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="43" bcv="NEH.12.43" /> \begin{signline}Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="44" bcv="NEH.12.44" />\begin{signline}¶ And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="45" bcv="NEH.12.45" /> \begin{signline}And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Solomon his son.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="46" bcv="NEH.12.46" /> \begin{signline}For in the days of David and Asaph of old\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}there were\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="47" bcv="NEH.12.47" /> \begin{signline}And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}holy things\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}unto the children of Aaron.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><c id="13" />
<p><v id="1" bcv="NEH.13.1" /> \begin{signline}On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="2" bcv="NEH.13.2" /> \begin{signline}Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="3" bcv="NEH.13.3" /> \begin{signline}Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="4" bcv="NEH.13.4" />\begin{signline}¶ And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}allied unto Tobiah:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="5" bcv="NEH.13.5" /> \begin{signline}And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}to be given\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="6" bcv="NEH.13.6" />\begin{signline}But in all this\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}time\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="7" bcv="NEH.13.7" /> \begin{signline}And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="8" bcv="NEH.13.8" /> \begin{signline}And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="9" bcv="NEH.13.9" /> \begin{signline}Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="10" bcv="NEH.13.10" />\begin{signline}¶ And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}them:\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="11" bcv="NEH.13.11" /> \begin{signline}Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="12" bcv="NEH.13.12" /> \begin{signline}Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="13" bcv="NEH.13.13" /> \begin{signline}And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}to distribute unto their brethren.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="14" bcv="NEH.13.14" /> \begin{signline}Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="15" bcv="NEH.13.15" />\begin{signline}¶ In those days saw I in Judah\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}some\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}treading  wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}manner of\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}against them\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}in the day wherein they sold victuals.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="16" bcv="NEH.13.16" /> \begin{signline}There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="17" bcv="NEH.13.17" /> \begin{signline}Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}is\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="18" bcv="NEH.13.18" /> \begin{signline}Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="19" bcv="NEH.13.19" /> \begin{signline}And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}some\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of my servants set I at the gates,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="20" bcv="NEH.13.20" /> \begin{signline}So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="21" bcv="NEH.13.21" /> \begin{signline}Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}so\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}more\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}on the sabbath.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="22" bcv="NEH.13.22" /> \begin{signline}And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}they should come\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}concerning\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.\end{signline}
<ve /></p><p><v id="23" bcv="NEH.13.23" />\begin{signline}¶ In those days also saw I Jews\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}that\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}and\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of Moab:\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="24" bcv="NEH.13.24" /> \begin{signline}And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="25" bcv="NEH.13.25" /> \begin{signline}And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}saying\end{signline}</add>\begin{signline}, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="26" bcv="NEH.13.26" /> \begin{signline}Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="27" bcv="NEH.13.27" /> \begin{signline}Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="28" bcv="NEH.13.28" />\begin{signline}And\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}one\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest,\end{signline} <add>\begin{signline}was\end{signline}</add> \begin{signline}son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="29" bcv="NEH.13.29" /> \begin{signline}Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="30" bcv="NEH.13.30" /> \begin{signline}Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;\end{signline}
<ve /><v id="31" bcv="NEH.13.31" /> \begin{signline}And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.\end{signline}
