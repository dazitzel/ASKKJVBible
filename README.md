# ASLKJVBible
American Sign Language translation of the King James Bible in USFX format.

This project started with permission from http://cyberjer.com/signbibl/ to use the translation partially completed and a stripped down King James Version of the text in English.

The first step is to simply check in is simply getting the English text into place --- done.

The next step is to make the current English text look better as generated from the ebible tool https://github.com/kahunapule/haiola --- done.
The text of the bible is readable though the book titles are mirrored and the book titles don't appear in the margins.
I am considering it done because experiments have shown that if I "translate" a book title into SignWriting then both show up correctly.

The next step in to apply transcriptions of http://cyberjer.com/signbibl/ --- in progress.
